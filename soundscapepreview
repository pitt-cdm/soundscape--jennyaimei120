Like I said before, my plan for the soundscape project is going to be me going throughout my day. 
You will be able to follow me through my schedule, and essentially be able to tell what I am doing.
I will have some voices included, using my friends during normal conversations throughout the day.
Some things in the soundscape may be just from my own leisure time. 
With the screenshot I put up on my repository, I only have two audio files up on there now. 
The two files are me getting up in the morning going downstairs, brushing my teeth and showering. 
The first sound clip is cut because the recording was too long to start with. 
I am planning to put on each sound clip one at a time and play with them to see what fits and what does not. 
At some point I will have to go back to edit sounds and to make the audio sound clean, not choppy.
The other sounds I have recorded are some lectures, walking to class, talking to friends, going to the gym, Starbucks and going to bed.
When listening to my soundscape, you will definitely be able to tell what I am doing and where I am at.
I also have to figure out what order to put everything in since my phone will not let me change the name of the recordings I took. 
After I figure that out I should be set to put everything in order.
